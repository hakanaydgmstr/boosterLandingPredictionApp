# boosterLandingPredictionApp
This is a Streamlit App that make predicts whether the first stage of Falcon 9 would be landed. The app also contains the EDA process of the dataset that was used to develop the classification model.
This project was originally from the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate program. I took the project, wanted to try different methods, and wanted to learn how can I create an app for data science projects. With this project, I gained some experience in both data science and data analysis. I also learned some tools on Streamlit library.
